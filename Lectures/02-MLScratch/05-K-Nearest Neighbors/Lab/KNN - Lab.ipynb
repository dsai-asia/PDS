    "Modify the KNN scratch code in our lecture such that:\n",
    "- If the majority class of the first place is equal to the second place, then ask the algorithm to pick the next nearest neighbors as the decider\n",
    "- Modify the code so it outputs the probability of the decision, where the probability is simply the class probability based on all the nearest neighbors\n",
    "- Write a function which allows the program to receive a range of k, and output the cross validation score.  Last, it shall inform us which k is the best to use from a predefined range\n",
    "- Put everything into a class <code>KNN(k=3)</code>.  It should have at least one method, <code>predict(X_train, X_test, y_train)</code>"
