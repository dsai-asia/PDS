    "Mini-Batch will rarely converge, thus it is important to add a max_iteration or some tolerance.  Last, theoretically speaking, Mini-Batch will never perform better in terms of accuracy when compare to K-means, but it is very close to optimal but will almost always beat K-means in terms of time given large dataset and a modest tolerance parameter."
