    "* I am sitting in either room **101** or **203** most of the time.  Please send emails to my calendar - chaklam@ait.asia for appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "* Room 203 also has many machine learning books I used for this class.  You are not allowed to take them away - but you are certainly welcomed to read them at my lab mini library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For online folks, you can always schedule a zoom meeting with me by sending me emails.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Setting up your Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* I use **python3** as interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be using a lot of modules that may not be pre-built in python, so I assume you know how to use pip to install missing modules.   I also assume you use linux systems since I have no experience in Windows :)  Read **0 - Installation** if you haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly recommend to use **venv** to setup your python environment, before installing python modules.  If you do not know how and what is venv, read this.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.  Docker is welcomed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes, it will take like several hours (like 3 to 4 hours) to run your model.  CSIM has some resources which you can use to help your model train faster.  One is the puffer system.  You can access it using https://puffer.cs.ait.ac.th  (in CSIM), which got four 2080Tis, 64GBs Ram, and very powerful CPU (I don't remember the series).  You must use your CSIM account to access and has been allocated a certain space amount.  Note that ~jovyan/ is all temporary, going away when the user's server is shut down. ~jovyan/work is persistent.   All notebooks are automatically stored in /work so do not worry your file will be lost.   The current server is a work-in-progress so make sure you backup!  There are also some PCs you can use at CSIM lab which has one NVIDIA 2060 super, i7, so that's plenty for you to run your model as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites / Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course aims for **technical, research oriented** audience who would like to develop **fundamental** skills needed to link math, data sicence, and python seemlessly together.  Afterall, this is a Master degree course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Thus, this course shall focus on **coding from scratch**. This has several reasons/benefits: \n",
    "    - a) You can keep up with the recent trend by reading papers by yourself and then write them yourself in python, \n",
    "    - b) Understanding from the fundamentals will help you advance in the future,\n",
    "    - c) There are too many youtube videos on sklearn and mostly can be self-learned, not to mention that Rapidminer and many other software can do it.  I would like to focus more on things that are difficult to self-learn.\n",
    "    - d) There are other courses such as **Business Intelligence** that aims more toward **business** audience.\n",
    "      \n",
    "* **Math, especially knowledge in linear algebra, differential calculus, and gaussian statistics are required**.  I assume that you know most of them.  This will be a very difficult course without any mathematical backgrounds. For your own deeper study, I recommend the followings:\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra short recap - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf;  Recommended book - http://linear.axler.net; Recommended playlist (Prof. Gilbert Strang) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8\n",
    "    - Stats - http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/ (free!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Python** is assumed to be known before you enroll this course.  I shall give you a crash course, but for those without any prior experience in Python, it will be extremely difficult.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* I have prepare some tutorials you must self-study with the beginning \"0\". Please look through them as it will be helpful to understand the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course is best taken together with **Machine Learning with Prof. Matthew Dailey**, where you can study the full derivation of formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very practical course.  **Intermediate level**. Could be **extremely** difficult for those without any programming experience.  Requires **huge huge amount of self-study hours**, especially if you are weak in programming/math. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Always read before you come to the class.  It will be very helpful to your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of *ouptput* students this course wants to produce\n",
    "\n",
    "I have actually high expectations of myself to develop strong mathematical and programming skills in students.  Here are what I expect the students who finish my course will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **code python fluently**, with good object-oriented (OO) and software engineering (SE) principles.  In a sense, students should be able to write class in a \"clean\", \"efficient\", and \"pythonic\" way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **self-study** advanced python stuffs in the future by increasing literacy in reading APIs, documentations, etc.  Thus, I encourage students to read APIs frequently, instead of just copying answers from StackOverflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **read mathematics** on any given research papers without too much difficulty.  Thus I shall cover machine learning algorithms from the perspectives of mathematics, as a mean for you to get acquainted with mathematics.  Also, we shall ask you to read LOTs of papers in your project, to get you acquainted with maths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **translate those mathematical knowledge to python programming**.  Thus, our class will focus on coding from scratch, rather than using library such as sklearn or pytorch but sklearn and pyTorch will be taught as well but will not be the focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to understand what are some useful machine learning algorithms, how to implement them, and most importantly, *when* or *when NOT* to use them.  Thus I shall regularly compare and contrast different algorithms, i.e., weakness and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to **self-explore, self-learn beyond the course materials, and link all the knowledge** you have, and combined with your own unique background (e.g., economics, medicine, finance, retail) to solve a particular data problem.  More importantly, able to *judge whether a problem is worth solving*.   Thus I shall hope that project is a good starting point.\n",

    "### Mini Project\n",
    "\n",
    "One of this course main goals is to prepare you to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world tasks, or to leave you well-qualified to start machine learning or AI research. \n",
    "\n",
    "A total of three mini projects are to make you prepared for the mega project.  This will be done solely by you alone to ensure you develop essential skills reuqired to complete the mega project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to pick a project topic. To pick a project topic for a mini-project, you are required to read **at least 3 papers** of the recent 3-5 years. It can be useful to look up existing research on relevant topics by searching related keywords on an academic search engine such as: http://scholar.google.com. Also, I have prepared a list of must read papers in \"0 - Reading Roadmap\" which should be a good start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of designing your project is to identify one or several **datasets** suitable for your topic of interest. If that data needs considerable pre-processing  to suit your task, or that you intend to collect the needed data yourself, keep in mind that this is only one part of the expected project work, but can often take considerable time. We still expect a solid methodology and discussion of results, so pace your project accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be using Google classroom for submission.  Deliverables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A github repository containing\n",
    "    - README file explaining the work\n",
    "    - PPT / Slides\n",
    "    - Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "    - Dataset (if too big, link to GDrive)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Project will be evaluated based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The technical quality of the work.** (I.e., Does the technical material make sense? Are the things tried reasonable? Are the proposed algorithms or applications clever and interesting? Do the authors convey novel insight about the problem and/or algorithms?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significance**. (Did the authors choose an interesting or a “real\" problem to work on, or only a small “toy\" problem? Is this work likely to be useful and/or have impact?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The novelty of the work.** (Is this project applying a common technique to a well-studied problem, or is the problem or method relatively unexplored?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to highlight these components, it is important you present a solid discussion regarding the learnings from the development of your method, and summarizing how your work compares to existing approaches.  Last but not least, we tend to judge anything that is publishable or nearly to be a A project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to spend 5 minutes to present your project in front of the class and 2 more minutes for Q&A.  Make sure to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem\n",
    "- Related Work (at least 3 papers)\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Should project use only methods taught in classroom?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, we encourage you to read more recent papers and recent methods.  But make sure you always include some **baseline methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can I use libraries like sklearn or pyTorch or from scratch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any libraries are fine but Python is a must.  For deep learning, we highly recommend you using pyTorch because I and the TAs ONLY know pyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can I not use Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.  There is optional tool like bitbucket but we found that it is just too much hurdles for TAs and mentors to look at different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is there any particular project we don't recommend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, example projects such as those tutorials in Kaggle or medium.com will NOT be ok.  We judge for novelty, significance, and technicality, so usually those projects will not be sufficient.  Also, if you want to work on certain project, make sure you have enough domain knowledge.  For example, if you want to work on finance, make sure you know finance really well."

    "\n",
    "Mega project assumes you to combine all your gained expertise to creatively create something. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "**To pick a project topic for the mega-project, you are required to read at least 20 papers of the recent 3-5 years.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most students do one of three kinds of projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application project.** This is by far the most common: Pick an application that interests you, and explore how best to apply learning algorithms to solve it.  Of course, you will then need to read 20 papers, mostly application oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic project**. Pick a problem or family of problems, and develop a new learning algorithm, or a novel variant of an existing algorithm, to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Theoretical project.** Prove some interesting/non-trivial properties of a new or an existing learning algorithm. (This is often quite difficult, and so very few, if any, projects will be purely theoretical.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some projects will also combine elements of applications, algorithms and theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many fantastic class projects come from students picking either an application area that they're interested in, or picking some subfield of machine learning that they want to explore more. So, pick something that you can get **excited and passionate about!** Be brave rather than timid, and do feel free to propose ambitious things that you're excited about. (Just be sure to read a lot of papers, and consult your mentor if you're uncertain how to best get started.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A very good project (grade A) will be a publishable or nearly-publishable piece of work**. Each year, some number of students continue working on their projects, submitting their work to a conferences or journals. Thus, for related work, you might also look at some recent machine learning research papers. Two of the main machine learning conferences are ICML and NIPS. You can find papers from the recent ICML https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule and NeurIPS conference https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have identified a topic of interest, it can be useful to look up existing research on relevant topics by searching related keywords on an academic search engine such as: http://scholar.google.com. \n",

We still expect a solid methodology and discussion of results, so pace your project accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on a few specific types of projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep learning projects**: Since our course discusses many other concepts besides deep learning, we ask that if you decide to work on a deep learning project, please make sure that you use other material you learned in the class as well. For example, you might set up logistic regression and SVM baselines, or do some data analysis using the unsupervised methods covered in class. We may grade these projects using different criteria to make sure that grading is fair for students who have not had exposure to DL before. Finally, training deep learning models can be very time consuming, so make sure you have the necessary computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessed datasets**: While we don't want you to have to spend much time collecting raw data, the process of inspecting and visualizing the data, trying out different types of preprocessing, and doing error analysis is often an important part of machine learning. Hence if you choose to use preprepared datasets (e.g. from Kaggle, the UCI machine learning repository, etc.) we encourage you to do some data exploration and analysis to get familiar with the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replicating results**: Replicating the results in a paper can be a good way to learn. However, we ask that instead of just replicating a paper, also try using the technique on another application, or do some analysis of how each component of the model contributes to final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Parts: Proposal, Progress Report, and Final Report Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains the detailed instructions for the different parts of your project.  Make sure you plan ahead!\n",

    "**Group number**: 1-3 people.  No more than 3 people will be allowed, except for cases of uneven division.  No special treatment for lone wolves as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "The progress report will help you make sure you're on track, and should describe what you've accomplished so far, and very briefly say what else you plan to do. You should write it as if it's an “early draft\" of what will turn into your final project. You can write it as if you're writing the first few pages of your final project report, so that you can re-use most of the progress report text in your final report. Please write the milestone (and final report) keeping in mind that the intended audience are the instructors and the mentors. Thus, for example, **you should not spend two pages explaining what logistic regression is**. Your milestone should include the full names of all your team members and state the full title of your project. Note: We will expect your final writeup to be on the same topic as your progress report.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Motivation: What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result?\n",
    "- Related work: What are the gap of the current work?\n",
    "- Method: What machine learning techniques are you planning to apply or improve upon?\n",
    "- Preliminary experiments: Describe the experiments that you've run, the outcomes, and any error analysis that you've done. You should have tried at least one baseline.\n",
    "- Next steps: Given your preliminary results, what are the next steps that you're considering?\n",

    "*Grading* - The progress report is mainly intended to make sure you are making a reasonable progress and get feedback early.

    "        \n",
    "1. Should project use only methods taught in classroom?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, we encourage you to read more recent papers and recent methods.  But make sure you always include some **baseline methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can I use libraries like sklearn or pyTorch or from scratch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any libraries are fine but Python is a must.  For deep learning, we highly recommend you using pyTorch because I and the mentors ONLY know pyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can I not use Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.  There is optional tool like bitbucket but we found that it is just too much hurdles for TAs and mentors to look at different places.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is there any particular project we don't recommend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, example projects such as those tutorials in Kaggle or medium.com will NOT be ok.  We judge for novelty, significance, and technicality, so usually those projects will not be sufficient.  Also, if you want to work on certain project, make sure you have enough domain knowledge.  For example, if you want to work on finance, make sure you know finance really well."
