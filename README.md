# Python for DSAI

This is the repository for the course Python for DSAI at Asian Institute of Technology.

It contains mostly notebooks and datasets required for the lectures.

Some resource worth mentioning:

1. 0 - Reading Roadmap
  - For those who wants to know what papers to read.  I have listed ONLY the most important papers you need to read in the field of machine learning
2. 0 - Installation
  - For newbies who have trouble installing Python and other tools
3. 0 - Course Notations
  - Understanding notations is the first step towards conquering math, so take a look and familiarized with it

This course is a 15 weeks course, each week having two labs of 3 hours each.

The course is structured into 3 big components, mostly focusing on preprocessing and modeling perspectives:
