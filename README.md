Some resource worth mentioning:

1. Lectures/Starters/0 - Reading Roadmap
  - For those who wants to know what papers to read.  I have listed ONLY the most important papers you need to read in the field of machine learning
2. Lectures/Starters/0 - Installation
  - For newbies who have trouble installing Python and other tools
3. Lectures/Starters/0 - Course Notations
  - Understanding notations is the first step towards conquering math, so take a look and familiarized with it
  
I would also like to give credits to several githubs that I have revised to creat this:

- https://github.com/drgona/Pytorch_bootcamp_Udemy
- https://github.com/SethHWeidman/DLFS_code
- https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook

This course is a 15 weeks course, each week having two labs of 3 hours each.

The course is structured into 3 big components, mostly focusing on preprocessing and modeling perspectives:
