Some resource worth mentioning:

1. Lectures/Starters/0 - Reading Roadmap
  - For those who wants to know what papers to read.  I have listed ONLY the most important papers you need to read in the field of machine learning
2. Lectures/Starters/0 - Installation
  - For newbies who have trouble installing Python and other tools
3. Lectures/Starters/0 - Course Notations
  - Understanding notations is the first step towards conquering math, so take a look and familiarized with it
4. Lectures/Advanced
  - These are lessons I do not intend to teach given the time limit.  It is intended for self-study.
5. Self-Exercises
  - Every Lecture has a lab folder containing the assessment and solution.  Anyhow, I also compile a list of possible exercises for student's self learning inside the Self-Exercises folder.
6. AIT-2020
  - The file "0. Course Introduction.ipynb" contains how I run the course.  This course is a 15 weeks course, each week having two labs of 3 hours each.  Each lab always end with the assessment and solution.
  
I would also like to give credits to several githubs that I have revised to create this:

- https://github.com/drgona/Pytorch_bootcamp_Udemy
- https://github.com/SethHWeidman/DLFS_code
- https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook

The course is structured into 3 big components, mostly focusing on preprocessing and modeling perspectives:
